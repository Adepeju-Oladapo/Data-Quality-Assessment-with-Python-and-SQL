# Data-Quality-Assessment-with-Python-and-SQL

### This repository contains the code implemented in the first task of my virtual internship with KPMG through Forage.

#### For this task I was instructed to take a look at the four datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd and identify all data quality issues. The data quality assessment was done with Python and SQL.
