# Data-Quality-Assessment-with-Python-and-SQL

### This repository contains the code implemented in the first task of my virtual internship with KPMG through Forage.

As part of the task, I examined four datasets provided by Sprocket Central Pty Ltd (via KPMG) and identified any data quality issues. The data quality assessment was performed using Python and SQL, and all of the implemented code can be accessed via the attached Jupyter notebook.

The goal of the task was to highlight all notable data quality issues, methods used to mitigate them, and recommendations to avoid the reoccurrence of these issues. This approach aimed to enhance the precision of the underlying data utilized to inform business decisions, which was then communicated to the client via email. 

The attached pdf file (email) contains all significant findings and recommendations.
